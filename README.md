# Note Taker

## Description

This repository is where I modified starter code to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

![The note taker application shows existing notes in the left-hand column with empty fields on the right-hand side for the new noteâ€™s title and text.](TBA)

[Deployed website] (https://mmmatson.github.io/note-taker/)

Click on the link to the "notes" page when on the landing page to be taken to a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note's title and text in the right-hand column.

A save icon will appear when you enter a new note's title and text. When you click the save icon, the new note will appear under the existing notes left-hand column. When you click on an existing note in the left-hand column, then the selected note's title and text will appear in the right-hand column. 

When you click on the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then you'll be presented with empty fields to enter a new note's title and text in the right-hand column.
